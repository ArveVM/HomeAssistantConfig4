# Home-Assistant_config #4

This repo contains (part of) the working Home Assistant configuration for our home. 
Below you find an overview of the devices currently being used, blog/video posts, and other HA enthusists that provided inspiration and configs to help build this config. All of the code is free to use; I only ask that you Star this repo.


### Current focus: 
- Create 'Solutions' where things are of such a standard that it is valuable to share (or I need to share to get input for my improvements,, )
It is still work in progress, so I will only publish what is actually transformed into this new "principle".

Have focused a lot this summer on home improvements outside the HA-sphere,, but used some time on UI minimalist and browser_mod popup,, to enable more info on/behind small chips/cards.


## Solutions: 
Current concept is moving towards a Solution beeing 
- a ReadMe-file to present concept and show screenshots, with reference to 
- a yaml-file with config and 
- one or more yaml-files for dashboard/card/chips.

| Solution  | Description/purpose |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Content Cell  | Content Cell  |
| [HA-stats](https://github.com/ArveVM/HomeAssistantConfig4/blob/master/avm_yaml/packages/solutions/hastats.md)  | my HA-instance's stats of sensor-count and yaml-line-count development  |

## Functionality: 
As from my config-principles; addons and integrations are the enablers of functionality.
All listed, but only those with some level of config or interest for myself/others are documented.

| Type  | Description | Description/purpose |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
|Integration| [Bluetooth](https://github.com/ArveVM/HomeAssistantConfig4/blob/master/avm_yaml/packages/integrations/bluetooth.md)| Enabler for BT-functionality |
|HACS-int| Browser mod  | v1.5.3 - used primarily for pop-up functionality |
|Integration| [BTHome](https://github.com/ArveVM/HomeAssistantConfig4/blob/master/avm_yaml/packages/integrations/bt_home.md) | BTHome-firmware flashed sensors |
|Integration| [Inkbird](https://github.com/ArveVM/HomeAssistantConfig4/blob/master/avm_yaml/packages/integrations/inkbird.md) | BT-sensors from Inkbird |
|Integration| [Shelly](https://github.com/ArveVM/HomeAssistantConfig4/blob/master/avm_yaml/packages/integrations/shelly.md) | How/why do I use this integration? |


### Guidance for others:
One last thing. Everything in this configuration is a combination of the things I want out of a home automation system flavored with the inspiration from others using Home Assistant. In some cases I took someone else's idea and made it my own, and in some I just completely stole it. So I would be remiss if I didn't acknowledge those that inpired this journey. If you like what you see here, please checkout their configs as well. I owe them thanks for sharing their work.

To prove this point; I even stole this text from thejeffreystone :)

### Further acknowlegement is added in code,,
### I've tried to add references to persons or sources whenever I've stolen something ;)


### Disclaimer:
- I consider myself on the bottom part of "list of greatest coder in the HA-community", but I might introduce a "how to see the big picture" approach that newbies like me might benefit from, both on understanding functionality and easy access to working solutions from others.
- English is NOT my native language - so if in doubt of what I'm thinking, please ask ;). And in advance; please excuse any verbal abuse or bad language,, I somethimes forget that I don't controll who read what I post online :(
- Please verify whatever you take away from my configuration compared to others,, there are so many good examples out theere (and a few of them are listed below).
- "My config principles" might seem obvious to the experienced HA user,, but from my perspective it gives a good overview of some ground-rules that give me structure and ability to add solution-based "packages" or share with others.
