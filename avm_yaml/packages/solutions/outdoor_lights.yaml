#   @solution     :   Outdoor light on/off
#   @description  :   Solution to make dumb appliances seem smart.  
#   @basic concept: 
#      Dumb outdoor lights are plugged into a Ikea smartplug which 
#      Z2M/Mosquitto integration provides data from to HA
#         sensors used:
#             switch.outdoor_light
#
#      https://community.home-assistant.io/t/evolution-of-an-automation-turn-a-light-on-off-at-sunset-sunrise/302465
#
#      (the switch can trun off in case of
#      extreme powersaving-solutions - some time in the future)

# AVM; anyone,, why is it not possible to customize a switch to a light and use light_off ??
# or if it is possible - how??

# and anyone with example of how to ensure power-on-behaviour  (currently set in z2m, reconfigure i Solution, or just document here?)
# select.outdoor_light_power_on_behavior = on



#: AVM; define my 'time-zones' for outdoor ligths
binary_sensor:
  - platform: tod
    name: TOD for Outdoor lights
    after: sunset
    after_offset: "-00:15:00"
#    after_offset: "-11:15:00"    # AVM; adjust to test to get sensor=on, then restart will trigger automation
    before: sunrise
    before_offset:  "00:15:00"


# AVM; then automate the on/off, including reset at startup HA
