# my Home Assistant statistics


## Why Home Assistant Statistics??  
- I'm actually rather fond of numbers and looking at development through history of a journey from an number perspective
- So I googled a bit, and found something I found useful, and created a 'solution' for hastats.

Focus so far have been on 
- development in entities (by domain
- and # of YAML-lines in my code

I've created the sensors in an solutions-yaml,, and will look into moving dashboards to separate -yaml-files for easy sharing (whenever something get updated,,,





```ruby
puts "Hello World"
  ddff
  dfdf
  dfdf
     
```
