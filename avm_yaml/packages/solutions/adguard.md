# AdGuard

<br />

## Intro:
### Why AdGuard?  
Need a way for the wife to control AdGuard (read; disable ad-blocking), so integrated it to HA and made a chip/popup from which she can control

### Credits/inspiration:
- lots of assistance and guiding from ThomasH: so hjuge thanks ;)

### Requirements/install tips/troubleshooting:

  #### Functionality required (other than what is builtin in my version of HA):
  - HACS: browser mod - for popup-functionality (now updated to browser_mod v2)
  - HACS: custom:button-card
  - HACS: custom:auto-entities
  - HACS: custom:fold-entity-row
  - HACS: custom:multiple-entity-row
  Optional
  - Dashboard:
    * yaml-dashboard (but you can copy dashboard-code to UI-dashboard/card 

  <br />
 
  #### To install you should:
  - Installed AdGuard docker
  - Installed HA Adguard-integration
  - add config to AdGuard-docker  
  - created chip/popup to view status
  - first set up packages/solutions as specified elsewhere in my brilliant documentation. 
  - copy and insert code for card whereever suitable for your installation
  - redo/change to your naming standards  :)

## How it works (for me):
- created chip/popup to view status from AdGuard-integration getting data from Adguard-docker


<br />
<br />

### Solution-Yaml:
n/a

<br />
<br />

### Solution-Dashboard(s):
[Chip Hotwater SoC](https://github.com/ArveVM/HomeAssistantConfig4/blob/master/avm_yaml/dashboard/cards/chip_hotwater_soc.yaml)

click - and you will get pop-up with more details:

## improvements planned/project queue:
- Better documentation of server/docker setup
- might do something with history/graphs  etc?
