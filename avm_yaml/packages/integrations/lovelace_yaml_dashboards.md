# Lovelace YAML-dashboards
[Official HA-documentation](https://www.home-assistant.io/dashboards/)




## How I use this integration:  
- Config to keep dashboards on UI, but enable the yaml-dashboards as well
- Dashboards in UI:                 https://www.home-assistant.io/dashboards/
- Combine UI and yaml-dashboards;   https://www.home-assistant.io/dashboards/dashboards/
- Used everything-smart-home tutorial for setup of Minimalist UI (which is stored in AVM_yaml/dashboard)


## Configuration:
[lovelace_yaml_dashboards.yaml](lovelace_yaml_dashboards.yaml)
- enable both UI and YAML dashboards
- Enable minimalist dashboard, and sidebar-entry


## toDo / plans ahead:
- further add dashboards in YAML
