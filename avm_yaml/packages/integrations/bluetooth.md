# Bluetooth-integration
[Official HA-documentation](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/bluetooth/)


## How I use Bluetooth-integration:
- Prereqs:
  - Install integration: Bluetooth is part of 'default_config:' from 2022.8
  - Bluetooth-radio:
    - Use ESPHome with ESP32's as Bluetooth-proxies to get Bluetooth range of (soon) the entire house
- Integration is used as platform for the following integrations
  - BTHome
  - Inkbird
  See furthter documentation on each integration
